# cpp_graphs

A simple graph library for practice/brushing up on basic graph algorithms and experimenting with modern C++ features.

The graph data structure is defined in [graph.h](graph.h).

Graph algorithms implemented:
* Dijkstra's shortest path ([dijkstra.h](dijkstra.h)),
* A* ([astar.h](astar.h)).
